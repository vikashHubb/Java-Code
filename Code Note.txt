isProbablePrime

	public boolean isProbablePrime(int certainty)
	Returns true if this BigInteger is probably prime, false if it's definitely composite. If certainty is â‰¤ 0, true is 	returned.

Parameters:
	certainty - a measure of the uncertainty that the caller is willing to tolerate: if the call returns true the 		probability that this BigInteger is prime exceeds (1 - 1/2certainty). The execution time of this method is 		proportional to the value of this parameter.

Returns:
	true if this BigInteger is probably prime, false if it's definitely composite.
